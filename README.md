# Survey Data Collection System
Welcome to the Survey Data Collection System! This system aims to efficiently gather crucial data using a web-based questionnaire (implemented in Django) addressing various groups' questions. Participants can access the questionnaire, and submit their responses anonymously, facilitating the data collection process. This collected data is fed to a mathematical model, the Network Scale-Up method, allowing us to estimate the scale of affected individuals.

## Key Features
1. **Web-based Questionnaire**: participants easily access and respond to the questionnaire online.
2. **Estimation Model**: We employ the innovative Network Scale-up Method (NSUM) to estimate hard-to-reach sub-populations based on social network connections.

Our mission is to provide a robust system that generates valuable insights, aiding in effective decision-making to manage the problem at hand.
